        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Although widely associated with <strong>Indian cuisine</strong>, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a wide variety of preparations and ingredients; however, it is typically prepared by layering seasoned chicken with rice and aromatics and steaming them together.</p>
        

        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.<img src="https://norecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chicken-biryani-3-720x405.jpg"></li>
            <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear.<img src="https://norecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chicken-biryani-1-720x405.jpg"></li>
            <li>Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.</li>
